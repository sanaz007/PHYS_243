## Session 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

We began by discussing what machine learning is—automating pattern recognition through data-driven algorithms. We also covered basic programming concepts in Python as a foundation.

**Covered Topics:**
- What is ML? Supervised vs. Unsupervised vs. Reinforcement Learning
- How computers “learn” from data
- Common ML applications (e.g., image recognition, finance, healthcare)
- Basic Python: variables, loops, conditionals, built-in functions
